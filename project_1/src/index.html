              <p>Methodology: The donation data come from the New York State Board of Elections reports:
                <a href="https://www.elections.ny.gov/CFViewReports.html">https://www.elections.ny.gov/CFViewReports.html</a>. The donations include those filed for candidates and their committees from January 2017 to January 2022. 
                The candidates included are those politicians that currently represent the five boroughs in the state Senate and Assembly, plus the Majority Leader of the Senate, Andrea Stewart Cousins, and the four statewide posititions:
                Governor, Lt. Governor, Comptroller, and Attorney General.   
                
                The donors were clustered accross different candidate's filings with the dedupe python library: <a href="https://github.com/dedupeio/dedupe">https://github.com/dedupeio/dedupe</a>. Additional
                human review is on-going. The intention is to continue to improve the mapping and naming of the linked donors. There were some candidates that weren't included because they had no
                filing committees that had recent filings clearly associated with their names. A review to include them is ongoing. If you see donors that should be included in the same cluster please submit them
